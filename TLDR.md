# TLDR for the TLDR

We're building a secure, decentralized communication protocol. Protocol v1.0.0 Jasper has multiple REST API servers in a mesh network. Clients connect to different TX (transmission) and RX (reception) servers. Servers can detect and report misbehaving servers. Everything is signed by users' keys.

# Introduction

Hey! This is Purple Bubble. We're a crew of teens on a mission to make messaging epic again. Zero tracking, spying, or data selling. Everything is end-to-end encrypted, anonymized, and decentralized. All open source.

> We mostly communicate through #purplebubble in the [Hack Club Slack](hack.club/slack), but since Hack Club is running a (super cool, you should check it out if you're a teen or younger) [summer event](hack.club/arcade), you will need to verify that you're not an adult to join. Worry not! You can always reach out to team@purplebubble.org or open a github issue.

# Why

These days, no one can really trust tech companies. Slack has [started training AI models on messages](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/05/slack-defends-default-opt-in-for-ai-training-on-chats-amid-user-outrage/), Discord is adding [ads to their app](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/discord-starts-down-the-dangerous-road-of-ads-this-week/).
